overleaf/web
==============

overleaf/web is the front-end web service of the open-source web-based collaborative LaTeX editor,
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
It serves all the HTML pages, CSS and javascript to the client. overleaf/web also contains
a lot of logic around creating and editing projects, and account management.


The rest of the Overleaf stack, along with information about contributing can be found in the
[overleaf/overleaf](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf) repository.

### Running the app

The app runs natively using npm and Node on the local system:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

### Running Tests

To run all tests run:
```
make test
```

To run both unit and acceptance tests for a module run:
```
make test_module MODULE=overleaf-integration
```

### Unit Tests

The test suites run in Docker.

Unit tests can be run in the `test_unit` container defined in `docker-compose.tests.yml`.

The makefile contains a short cut to run these:

```
make test_unit
```

During development it is often useful to only run a subset of tests, which can be configured with arguments to the mocha CLI:

```
make test_unit MOCHA_GREP='AuthorizationManager'
```

To run only the unit tests for a single module do:
```
make test_unit_module MODULE=overleaf-integration
```

Module tests can also use a MOCHA_GREP argument:
```
make test_unit_module MODULE=overleaf-integration MOCHA_GREP=SSO
```

### Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests are run against a live service, which runs in the `acceptance_test` container defined in `docker-compose.tests.yml`.

To run the tests out-of-the-box, the makefile defines:

```
make test_acceptance
```

However, during development it is often useful to leave the service running for rapid iteration on the acceptance tests. This can be done with:

```
make test_acceptance_app_start_service
make test_acceptance_app_run # Run as many times as needed during development
make test_acceptance_app_stop_service
```

`make test_acceptance` just runs these three commands in sequence and then runs `make test_acceptance_modules` which performs the tests for each module in the `modules` directory. (Note that there is not currently an equivalent to the `-start` / `-run` x _n_ / `-stop` series for modules.)

During development it is often useful to only run a subset of tests, which can be configured with arguments to the mocha CLI:

```
make test_acceptance_run MOCHA_GREP='AuthorizationManager'
```

To run only the acceptance tests for a single module do:
```
make test_acceptance_module MODULE=overleaf-integration
```

Module tests can also use a MOCHA_GREP argument:
```
make test_acceptance_module MODULE=overleaf-integration MOCHA_GREP=SSO
```
